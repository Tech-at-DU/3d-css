# 3d-css mini hackathon

**Purpose**: practice your craft, explore 3d CSS, and have fun.

Work by yourself or with someone else. Your goal is to create webpage that uses content from the CSS Zen Garden. For this project you are allowed to copy, paste, and edit the markup. You are not required to use all of of the markup. 

Start with one of these concepts and take it anywhere you imagine. 

- Book or card, flip pages 
- Cubic solid form or structure
- Solar system space travel
- City skyline, landscape

The only requirements are that you use CSS 3d transform properties like: rotate x, y, z, translate 3d, and perspective. 

There are a few sample files in this repository that have some ideas you can use as a starting point.

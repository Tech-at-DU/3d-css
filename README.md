# 3d-css mini hackathon

**Purpose**:
Practice your craft! Explore the creative side of **3D CSS**, and have fun.

Work solo or with a partner.

Choose a concept to inspire your design, then take it wherever your imagination leads.

- Book or Card: pages flip or unfold in space.
- Cubic Form: build a solid, a structure, or a rotating element in 3D.
- Solar System / Space Travel: orbiting layers, parallax stars, or spinning planets.
- City Skyline / Landscape: layered perspective with buildings, depth, and motion.

The only requirements are that you use CSS 3d transform properties like: rotate x, y, z, translate 3d, and perspective. 

There are a few sample files in this repository that have some ideas you can use as a starting point.
